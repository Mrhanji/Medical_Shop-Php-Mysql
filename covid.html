<h2>Coronavirus And Covid-19</h2>
<p>A <b>coronavirus</b> is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat. Most coronaviruses aren't dangerous.<br>
  <b>COVID-19</b>  is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract infection. It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).
 <br> It spreads the same way other coronaviruses do, mainly through person-to-person contact. Infections range from mild to deadly.
 SARS-CoV-2 is one of seven types of coronavirus, including the ones that cause severe diseases like Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The other coronaviruses cause most of the colds that affect us during the year but aren’t a serious threat for otherwise healthy people.

<br><br><h2>How long will the coronavirus last?</h2>
<p>There's no way to tell how long the pandemic will continue. There are many factors, including the public’s efforts to slow the spread, researchers’ work to learn more about the virus, their search for a treatment, and the success of the vaccines.</p>
<br><br>

<h2>Symtoms of Covid-19</h2>
<div >
  <img  class="cough" src="images/cough.jpg">
</div>
<p>The main symptoms include:</p>

  <li>Fever</li>
  <li>Coughing</li>
 <li>Shortness of breath</li> 
  <li>Trouble breathing</li>
  <li>Fatigue</li>
  <li>Chills, sometimes with shaking</li>
  <li>Body aches</li>
  <li>Headache</li>
  <li>Sore throat</li>
  <li>Congestion/runny nose</li>
  <li>Loss of smell or taste</li>
  <li>Nausea</li> 
  <li>Diarrhea</li><p>
  The virus can lead to <b>pneumonia</b>, respiratory failure, heart problems, liver problems, <b>septic shock</b>, and death. Many COVID-19 complications may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm. This is when an infection triggers your immune system to flood your bloodstream with inflammatory proteins called cytokines.<br>
<br>If you notice the following severe symptoms in yourself or a loved one, get medical help right away:
</p>
<li><b>Trouble breathing</b> or shortness of breath</li>
<li>Ongoing <b>chest pain</b> or pressure</li>
<li>New confusion</li>
<li>Can’t wake up fully</li>
<li>Bluish lips or face</li><br>
<p>
If you’re infected, symptoms can show up in as few as 2 days or as many as 14. It varies from person to person.
<br>
According to researchers in China, these were the most common symptoms among people who had COVID-19:</p>
</p>
<li>Fever 99%</li>
<li>Fatigue 70%</li>
<li>Cough 59%</li>
<li>Lack of appetite 40%</li>
<li>Body aches 35%</li>
<li>Shortness of breath 31%</li>
<li>Mucus/phlegm 27%</li><br>
<p>Some people who are hospitalized for COVID-19 have also have dangerous blood clots, including in their legs, lungs, and arteries.
</p><br>
<h2>What to do if you think you have it?</h2>
<p>If you live in or have traveled to an area where COVID-19 is spreading:</p>
<li><b id="points">If you don’t feel well, stay home.</b>Even if you have mild symptoms like a headache and runny nose, stay in until you’re better. This lets doctors focus on people who are more seriously ill and protects health care workers and people you might meet along the way. You might hear this called self-quarantine. Try to stay in a separate room away from other people in your home.</li>
<li><b id="points">Call the doctor if you have trouble breathing.</b> You need to get medical help as soon as possible. Calling ahead (rather than showing up) will let the doctor direct you to the proper place, which may not be your doctor’s office. If you don’t have a regular doctor, call your local board of health. They can tell you where to go for testing and treatment.</li>
<li><b id="points">Follow your doctor’s advice and keep up with the news on COVID-19. </b>Between your doctor and health care authorities, you’ll get the care you need and information on how to prevent the virus from spreading.
</li>
<br><br>
<h2>How do I know if it’s COVID-19, a cold, or the flu?</h2> 
<p>Symptoms of COVID-19 can be similar to a <b>bad cold</b> or the flu. Your doctor will suspect COVID-19 if:</p>
<li>You have a fever and a cough.</li>
<li>You have been exposed to people who have it within the last <b>14 days</b>.</li>
